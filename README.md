## About
With help of Flask I wrote an API according to this documentation https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md

## Storage 
~~All data is stored in memory. I plan to use Postgres DB for that.~~

First I implemented the project with all data stored in memory. Please, follow the link to see it: https://github.com/ivozna/books-api/tree/1585bf45b4e0b8590c4e6a74bd1076942e9f31fc

Then I migrated the project to postgres - see master.
